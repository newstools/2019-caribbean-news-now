ST GEORGE’S, Grenada – Brendon La Touche is currently in the United States participating in the US Department of State’s International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP). He is taking part in a three-week project on “Combating Trafficking in Persons” from July 6 to July 27. 



La
Touche is a Crown Counsel in the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions
(DPP) in Grenada. The office of the DPP is responsible for the effective
prosecution of all criminal related matters in Grenada.



During
the program, he and other participants will review US government strategies to
combat international trafficking in persons, including crimes against women and
children, by examining the formulation, administration, and enforcement of US
policy on the national, state and local levels. The participants will also explore
initiatives to recognize, protect, and assist victims of abuse and trafficking,
including victim recovery and reintegration programs; and investigate
international law enforcement cooperation in trafficking in persons cases.



The
International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP) is the Department of State’s
premier professional exchange program. The program brings together emerging
leaders in their respective professions to learn from how US experts in this
profession operate, and to share best practices with the other program fellows
who hail from the same region and across the globe.
